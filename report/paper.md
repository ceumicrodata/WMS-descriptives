title: "Communist Era Managers in Modern Times: A Comparison of Management Skills Across Countries and Generations"
geometry: margin=2.54cm

The gist of this project is to investigate how the management practices differ in cohorts from the communist era in the Post-Communist block vs. the standard western countries. We introduce in our analysis a brand new wave of World Management Survey for Hungary and would like to include European countries like Germany, France, Poland to complement the data. We plan to measure the effect of being a post-communist manager with a comparison of cohort effects using simple DiD apprach between post-communist and western block countries. Our current analysis for Hungary shows that there is a negative effect by the age cohorts with a significant drop in the scores for the communist-era cohorts. The comparison should verify whether the Hungarian case is an anomaly or a pattern for post-communist countries to use deprecated practices which could explain some of the general differences in management practices across countries.
