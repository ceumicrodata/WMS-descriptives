There are households with heterogeneous manager skills. Taxes may depend on amount of input purchases by firm. There is selection: only those with high skills become managers. Calibrate to US size distribution and analyze effect of frictions. There is no training, no OLG friction.

> Bhattacharya, Dhritiman, Nezih Guner, and Gustavo Ventura. 2013. “Distortions, Endogenous Managerial Skills and Productivity Differences.” _Review of Economic Dynamics_ 16 (1): 11–25.

Model the accumulation of manager skills over the life cycle. Derive implications for the FSD. When there are distortions, managers may underinvest in their skills.

Using micro data in many countries, the paper shows that the wages of managers increase faster with age than that of workers. The gap in returns to age is positively correlated with GDP per capita. This is not driven by professions, nor by self employed. The paper introduces a model where managers can invest in their skills. Do counterfactuals in the model. School choice is not modeled, there is a reduced-form production function for skill.

Managers and project owners match in frictionless markets. There is PAM. To introduce frictions, a fraction of managers are randomly assigned. Quantify the the effect of mismatch on aggregate TFP in US data.

> Gomes, Pedro, and Zoë Kuehn. 2017. “Human Capital and the Size Distribution of Firms.” _Review of Economic Dynamics_ 26 (October): 164–79.

Across countries, but also within, schooling is positively correlated with firm size. Uses World Bank Enterprise survey across countries - strongest correlation is with fraction of secondary educated. In the model, there are three schooling outcomes, and a selection on innate skill within each schooling category. Just like in our model. The different schooling cohorts then compete, just like in our model. There are no closed form solutions. Concludes with policy analysis.

Use data from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and Amadeus to measure how FSD differs across countries. GEM has data on attitudes, schooling, taxes of entrepreneurs. Richer countries have larger firms. Model assumes entrepreneurial ability and technical progress are complements.

Use proprietary cross-country data on wages on middle managers. They are relatively more expensive in poor countries. Models two sectors: with and without managers. Countries where management is relatively costly have low modern sector. This latter is measured as the share of managerial occupations in ILO data (?), basically concluding there is a downward sloping demand for managers. Employment by sex and occupation - ISCO level 2 (thousands) | Annual", ILO code “EMP_TEMP_SEX_OC2_NB_A", downloaded from https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/Excel/INDICATOR/EMP_TEMP_SEX_OC2_NB_A_EN.xlsx on March 1, 2022.

> Esfahani, Mehrdad. 2019. “Investment in Skills, Managerial Quality, and Economic Development.” _SSRN_. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3527844.

Use data from IPUMS International for 38 countries and GEM to show how education and occupation varies with development. All self-employed are classified as managers, resulting in poor countries having more managers. Model setup is similar to ours: both education and occupation are chosen, the latter based on a innate managerial talent. Uses joint distribution of educational and managerial talent. Similar to Guner et al 2018, but with heterogeneous educational talent.

Use administrative data from US to measure the returns to entrepreneurship. People who spend at least 12 years in self employment make much more by age 55. People with high labor (relative to asset) income are more likely to become entrepreneurs. Develop a model with firm-specific investment and learning about entrepreneurial talent.

(This paper also relevant for `machines`.) Use within-firm time-use data from 1,000 firms in Uganda. Story is that of artesanal work, not specialized large-scale production. About 85% of employees work on all steps of production. (Is it necessarily demand driven or a failure to organize production in a more standardized way?)

Use the large-scale WW2 training program of the US that treated 200,000 managers at civilian production facilities. Outcomes are retrospective as reported in reunion books of their B.A. colleges. Identification relies on RDD of entry test score. Trained managers were more likely to be promoted or move to better firms. They also engaged in more entrepreneurial activity. Treatment effects were larger for non-white and female managers. The program, in all disciplines, reached 1.8 million students, 40 percent of the college population. Curriculum was centralized, 18-month MBA style, designed by AACSB.

## Micro evidence on educational interventions

Exploit a 1961 Italian reform of university entry requirements into STEM degrees: students from technical high schools were also allowed to apply. STEM freshmen increased from 12k to 38k. Graduates had faster career progression, were more likely to patent, especially in certain fields. They suffer with name-based matching to patents.
